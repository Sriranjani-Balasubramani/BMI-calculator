Objective
-The objective of this project is to create a simple Python script that calculates Basal Metabolic Rate (BML) based on user input.
-BML is the amount of energy expended while at rest, representing the minimum amount of energy required to keep the body functioning at rest.

Overview
-This Python script provides a convenient way for users to calculate their BML by inputting their weight, height, age, and gender. 
-BML is an essential metric for individuals looking to manage their weight, plan their diet, or engage in fitness activities.
-By knowing their BML, users can better understand their daily caloric needs and make informed decisions about their nutrition and exercise routines.

Features
-Simple Interface: The script provides a straightforward command-line interface for users to input their information.
-Accurate Calculation: The BML calculation is based on well-established formulas and takes into account weight, height, age, and gender.
-Quick Results: Users receive instant feedback on their BML after providing their information, making it easy to incorporate into their daily routines.
-Customizable: Users can easily modify the script to suit their specific needs or integrate it into other projects.
